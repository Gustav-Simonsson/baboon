        <h1>Open Bounties</h1>
        Our bug bounty program spans e2e: From Soundness of protocols (such as blockchain consensus, wire and p2p, proof of work, ...) and protocol/implementation compliance to network security and consensus integrity. Of course, more classical client security as well as security of cryptographic primitives form also part of the program. Please have a look at <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Security-Categorization">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Security-Categorization</a> for our security goals. For details on the scope, see below. 
        <h3><b>Protocol security</b></h3>
         The idea for ethereum was initially published in the white paper <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper">https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper</a>  . We have casted this concept into a couple of protocols and algorithms that are up for scrutiny, such as 
         <ul>
          <li>Block chain consensus protocol, state engine and virtual machine as well as encoding and Merkle Patricia trees as specified in <a href="http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf">http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf</a> </li>
          <li>Wire and p2p protocol as well as mining algorithm are still undergoing changes. Reference to be published soon here.</li>
        </ul>
        Help us identifying flaws such as  
        <ul>
          <li>Conceptual security issues in the formal specification of the Ethereum protocol.</li>
          <li>Misaligned / unintended economic incentives. Flaws in game theory.</li>
          <li>Security weaknesses / attacks on the PoW algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        A concrete example could be a contract that consumes very little gas but leads to a lot of computational effort effectively opening the door for DoS attacks. 
        <h3><b>Implementation security</b></h3>
        We will release the genesis block together with our Go client. Please have a look at the references for a link to the code base.
        <h4><b>Client protocol implementation security</b></h4>
        Assuming, protocols and algorithms are flawless: Does the Go client implementation conforms to the formal protocol specification. Issues could include:
        <ul>
          <li>Validations of blocks, transactions and messages.</li>
          <li>Ethereum Virtual Machine code execution.</li>
          <li>Transaction execution.</li>
          <li>Contract creation.</li>
          <li>Message calls.</li>
          <li>Calculation and enforcement of gas and fees.</li>
        </ul>
        An example for a potential issue in this category is Bitcoin's "zero-day" flaw requiring a hard-fork: <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CVE-2010-5139">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CVE-2010-5139</a>
        <h4><b>Network security</b></h4>
        In this category, we look for generalized attacks on the whole network or a subset of it:
        <ul>
          <li>51% and other X% attacks.</li>
          <li>Finney attacks.</li>
          <li>Sybil attacks.</li>
          <li>Replay attacks.</li>
          <li>Transaction / messages malleability.</li>
          <li>(global) DoS.</li>
        </ul>
        Fro a global network based DoS example look at: <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CVE-2012-4684">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CVE-2012-4684</a>
        <h4><b>Node security</b></h4>
        Attacks on a single Go client relating to the Ethereum protocol:
        <ul>
          <li>DoS / resource abuse.</li>
          <li>Account / wallet address gathering/probing.</li>
          <li>Broadcast / withhold attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        DoS example: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287351">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287351</a>

        <h4><b>Client application security</b></h4>
        This category address more classical security issues, more precisely, attacks on a single Go client exposing general Go application or library vulnerabilities:
        <ul>
          <li>Memory vulnerability (invalid memory address, nil pointers, memory not properly released).</li>
          <li>Data type (e.g. integer) overflow / wrap around.</li>
          <li>Panics or not properly handled errors.</li>
          <li>Concurrency: synchronization, state, races.</li>
          <li>Issues related to external libraries used.</li>
        </ul>
        An example for a problem hidden in an external library can be found here: <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/">http://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/</a>
        <h4><b>Cryptographic primitives security</b></h4>
        Incorrect implementation / usage / configuration of:
        <ul>
          <li>Elliptic curve (secp256k1, ECDSA).</li>
          <li>Hash algorithms (Keccak-256).</li>
          <li>Merkle Patricia trees.</li>
        </ul>
