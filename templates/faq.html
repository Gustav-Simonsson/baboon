        <h3> So, the bug bounty program is time limited?</h3>
        <p>The program will run until TBD. </p>
        <h3>How are bounties paid out?</h3>
        <p>Rewards are paid out in bitcoin shortly after the end of the bug bounty program in March. Simply send us your bitcoin address. We lock in the bitcoinaverage.com USD/BTC rate at the time when we verify a submission. Rewards for submissions after 28th of February will be paid out at a later date, to be defined.</p>
        <h3>Can I donate my reward to charity?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We can donate your reward to an organization of your choice. For U.S. based bounty hunters, this would be an established 501(c)(3) charitable organization.</p>
        <h3>I reported an issue / vulnerability but have not received a response!</h3>
        <p>We aim to respond to submissions as fast as possible. Feel free to ping us if you have not received a response within a day or two.</p>
        <h3>I want to be anonymous / I do not want my name or nick in the Ethereum genesis block or on the leader board.</h3>
        <p>Submitting anonymously or with a pseudonym is OK, but will not be eligible for BTC rewards. To be eligible for BTC rewards, we need your real name.</p>
        <p>Please let us know if you do not want a submission counted towards the leader board and/or if you do not want to be mentioned in the genesis block for your contribution.</p>
        <h3>What are the points in the leaderboard?</h3>
        <p>Every found vulnerability / issue is assigned a point value. Bounty hunters are ranked on our leaderboard by total points. Points are based on the same metrics as rewards but allow for more flexibility. For example, if USD inflates heavily reward amounts would be adjusted accordingly, but points would not. Points also allows submitters who do not want rewards to still be ranked on the leaderboard.</p>
